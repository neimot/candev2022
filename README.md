Solution created by Team Neimot for the employee retention and mobility challenge.

# Challenge

**Retention and mobilization of talent among employment equity groups:** Help us identify and analyze factors affecting the mobility and retention of Employment Equity (EE) group members (women, indigenous peoples, racialized persons, and persons with disabilities) within ISED. Use supplementary research to support your analysis and provide recommendations to address gaps at the sub-group level (i.e. Black, Chinese employees), while considering factors such as education, skills, regional distribution, etc.
